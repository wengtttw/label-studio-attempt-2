## Personal info

After you create an account in Label Studio, you can update the following:

* First name
* Last name
* Phone number
* Profile image (use an image no larger than 1200 x 1200 pixels or 1024 KB)

Because your email address is your username, you cannot update it. If you need to change your email address, you will need to create a different user with the new email address. 

## Hotkeys

Use this page to configure custom hotkeys for your user account. 

### Actions

| Action                  | Description                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Export Hotkeys**      | Generate a JSON file that you can share with other Label Studio users.           |
| **Import Hotkeys**      | Copy and paste JSON-formatted custom hotkey mapping.                             |
| **Reset to Defaults**   | Reset all hotkeys to their default values.                                       |

### Set custom hotkeys

For each hotkey, click the default hotkeys listed next each action. Then, when prompted, press the keys that you would like to use instead.

!!! note
    Each hotkey can be a single character key (a number, letter, symbol) or it can be a combination of a character key and multiple control keys (for example, `Shift`, `Control` `Option`, etc).

<div class="enterprise-only">

## Personal access token

!!! note
    Whether this option appears depends on [settings at your organization level](access_tokens#Access-token-settings-for-orgs). 

Click **Create** to generate an access token. When creating a token, ensure you save it somewhere secure, as it will only be visible one time. 

While personal access tokens work seamlessly with the Label Studio SDK, if you are using HTTP API requests, you will need to take extra steps. See [Personal access tokens and the API](access_tokens#Personal-access-tokens-and-the-API). 

<div class="enterprise-only">

You organization administrators may optionally set an expiration date for all personal access tokens. 

</div>

## Legacy token

!!! note
    Whether this option appears depends on [settings at your organization level](access_tokens#Access-token-settings-for-orgs). 

This token is pre-generated for you to use. Legacy tokens are easier to use for some API tasks, but are generally less secure. For more information, see [Access tokens](access_tokens).  

Click **Renew** to generate a new token. Any existing scripts using your old token will lose their authorization and will need to be updated to include your new token.
