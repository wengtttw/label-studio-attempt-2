To use certain AI features across your organization, you must first set up a model provider. 


!!! note
    These models are not used with the Label Studio [AI Assistant](ask_ai). 

## About adding model providers

### User access 

Once added, these model providers can be used by anyone in your organization who is also using an AI-powered workflow. 
    
However, only users with access to the organization settings (Owner and Admins) can add and configure models. 

### Whitelisting network access

If you are restricting network access to your resource, you may need to whitelist HumanSignal IP addresses ([IP ranges on SaaS](saas#Outbound-Connections-IP-Addresses)) when configuring network security.

### Approaches

There are two approaches to adding a model provider API key. 

* In one scenario, you get one provider connection per organization, and this provides access to a set of whitelisted models. Examples include:

    * OpenAI
    * Vertex AI
    * Gemini
    * Anthropic

* In the second scenario, you add a separate API key per model. Examples include:

    * Azure OpenAI
    * Azure AI Foundry
    * Custom

!!! note
    If you have already configured model providers to use with [Prompts](prompts_overview), those will automatically be added to your organization-level providers.
