!!! note
    The home page is not available for environments using whitelabeling. 

#### Annotator Evaluation settings

There is a new Annotator Evaluation section under **Settings > Quality**.

When there are ground truth annotations within the project, an annotator will be paused if their ground truth agreement falls below a certain threshold.

For more information, see [**Annotator Evaluation**](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/project_settings_lse#annotator-eval).

#### New Insert Plugins menu and Testing interface

There are a number of new features and changes related to plugins:

- There is a new **Insert Plugins** menu available. From here you can insert a pre-built plugin that you can customize as necessary.
- When you add a plugin, you will see a new **Testing** panel below the plugin editing field. You can use this to verify what events are triggered, manually trigger events, and modify the sample data as necessary.
- To accompany the new **Insert Plugins** menu, there is [a new Plugins gallery](https://docs.humansignal.com/plugins/) in the documentation that discusses each option and has information on creating your own custom plugs.
- There is also a new setting that allows you to restrict access to the Plugins tab to Administrator users. By default, it is also available to Managers. This can be set through the Django admin panel.

#### Label Studio Converter CLI

When you install the Label Studio SDK, you can now use the `label-studio-converter` command from your terminal.

#### Miscellaneous

- Performance enhancements around how membership API requests are made.

- Added a new API call to rotate JWT tokens: [POST api/token/rotate](https://app.heartex.com/api/token/rotate/)


### Security

- Addressed a CSP issue by removing `unsafe-eval` usage.

- Added a rule that password resets will be limited to 5 per hour.

- Upgraded Babel to address vulnerabilities.

- Improved security on CSV exports.

- Removed an unused endpoint.

- By default, CORS is permissive. However, you can now set an environment variable to ensure it is in strict mode. Set **one** of the following:
    - `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`  
     A comma-separated list of Origin header values the Label Studio server will receive, e.g. `https://example.org,https://example.net`

    - `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES`  
      Same as above, except using regex. 
    - `CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS`  
        Set to `false` or `0` to reject all Origin header values (that is, allow no cross-origin requests). By default this is set to `true`.
