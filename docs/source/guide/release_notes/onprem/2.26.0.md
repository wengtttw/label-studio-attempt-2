## Label Studio Enterprise 2.26.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">Time series sync, new Multichannel tag for time series, spectrograms, playground 2.0, annotation result filtering</div>

*Jul 21, 2025*

Helm Chart version: [1.10.0](https://github.com/HumanSignal/charts/blob/master/heartex/label-studio/Chart.yaml)

### New features

#### Time series synchronization with audio and video

You can now use the sync parameter to align audio and video streams with time-series sensor data by mapping each frame to its corresponding timestamp.

For more information, see [Time Series Labeling with Audio and Video Synchronization](/templates/timeseries_audio_video).

#### Group multiple time series in one channel

There is a new [Multichannel tag](/tags/timeseries#MultiChannel) for visualizing time series data. You can use this tag to combine and view multiple time series channels simultaneously on a single channel, with synchronized interactions.

The Multichannel tag significantly improves the usability and correlation of time series data, making it easier for users to analyze and pinpoint relationships across different signals.

#### Spectrogram support for audio analysis

There is a new option to display audio files as spectrograms. You can further specify additional spectrogram settings such as windowing function, color scheme, dBs, mel bands, and more.

Spectrograms can provide a deeper level of audio analysis by visualizing frequency and amplitude over time, which is crucial for identifying subtle sounds (like voices or instruments) that might be missed with traditional waveform views.

#### Playground 2.0

The [Label Studio Playground](https://labelstud.io/playground/) is an interactive sandbox where you can write or paste your XML labeling configuration and instantly preview it on sample tasks—no local install required.

The playground has recently been updated and improved, now supporting a wider range of features, including audio labeling. It is also now [a standalone app](https://labelstud.io/playground-app) and automatically stays in sync with the main application.

!!! info Tip
    To modify the data input, use a comment below the `<View>` tags:

#### Filter on annotation results

When applying filters, you will see new options that correspond to annotation results.

These options are identified by the results chip and correspond to control tag names and support complex filtering for multiple annotation results. For example, you can filter by “includes all” or “does not include.”

This enhancement provides a much more direct, predictable, and reliable way to filter and analyze annotation results, saving time and reducing the chances of errors previously encountered with regex matching.

For more information, see [Filter annotation results](manage_data#Filter-annotation-results).

### Enhancements

#### Interactive view all

The **View All** feature when reviewing annotations has been improved so that you can now interact with all annotation elements side-by-side, making it easier to review annotations. For example, you can now play video and audio, move through timelines, and highlight regions.

#### Expanded email notifications

Users can now receive email notifications for various actions, including when they are invited to projects and workspaces, assigned tasks, and when a project is published or completed. You can opt out of notifications from the [Account & Settings page](user_account).

#### Support for JSONL and Parquet

Label Studio now supports more flexible JSON data import from cloud storage. When importing data, you can use JSONL format (where each line is a JSON object), and import Parquet files.

JSONL is the format needed for OpenAI fine-tuning, and the default format from Sagemaker and HuggingFace outputs. Parquet enables smoother data imports and exports for Enterprise-grade systems including Databricks, Snowflake, and AWS feature store,

This change simplifies data import for data scientists, aligns with common data storage practices, reduces manual data preparation steps, and improves efficiency by handling large, compressed data files (Parquet).

!!! note
    **Parquet support:** We do not support importing Parquet files that include predictions and/or annotations. 

#### Improved grid view configurability

You can now configure the following aspects of the Grid View in the Data Manager: 

- **Columns**
- **Fit images to width**

#### Usage & License page visibility

The **Billing & Usage** page has been renamed the **Usage & License** page. Previously this page was only visible to users in the Owner role. A read-only form of this page is now available to all users in the Admin role.

#### Enhanced control and visibility for storage proxies

There are two UI changes related to [storage proxies](storage#Pre-signed-URLs-vs-Storage-proxies):

- On the **Usage & License** page, a new **Enable Storage Proxy** toggle allows organization owners to disable proxying for all projects within the organization. When this setting is disabled, source storages must enable pre-signed URLs. If they are not enabled, the user will be shown an error when they try to add their source storage.
- On the **Source Storage** window, the toggle controlling whether you use pre-signed URLs now clearly indicates that OFF will enable proxying.

#### Enhanced delete actions from the Data Manager

When deleting annotations, reviews, or assignments, you can now select a specific user for the delete action. Previously, you were only able to delete all instances.

With this change, you will have more granular control over data deletion, allowing for precise management of reviews and annotations.

This enhancement is available for the following actions:

- **Delete Annotations**
- **Delete Reviews**
- **Delete Review Assignments**
- **Delete Annotator Assignments**

#### Session timeout configuration

Organization owners can use the new **Session Timeout Policies** fields to control session timeout settings for all users within their organization. These fields are available from the **Usage & License** page.

Owners can configure both the maximum session age (total duration of a session) and the maximum time between activity (inactivity timeout).


#### Miscellaneous UX improvements

- Improved the message text seen when building templates using Ask AI.

- Improved the scrolling action for the workspace list, making it easier for orgs with very large workspace lists.

- Users on the Organization page are now sorted by email by default.

- The **Delete Annotator Assignments** action is now disabled when the tooltip is in automatic task distribution mode.

- The **Data Import** step has been redesigned to better reflect the drag and drop target. The text within the target has also been updated for accuracy and helpfulness.

- The empty states of the labeling interface panels have been improved to provide user guidance and, where applicable, links to the documentation.

### Security

- In the Django admin settings, when **Common login enabled** is deselected, signups and invites are now also restricted.

- Webhooks are restricted to administrators.

- Addressed multiple security vulnerabilities.
