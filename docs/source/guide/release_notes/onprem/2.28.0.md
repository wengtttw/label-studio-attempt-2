## Label Studio Enterprise 2.28.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">Bitmasks, custom hotkeys, annotation summaries, project page improvements, and more</div>

*Aug 28, 2025*

Helm Chart version: [1.11.1](https://github.com/HumanSignal/charts/blob/master/heartex/label-studio/Chart.yaml)

### New features

#### Bitmask support for precise image annotation

We’ve introduced a new BitMask tag to support pixel-level image annotation using a brush and eraser. This new tag allows for highly detailed segmentation using brush-based region and a cursor that reflects brush size down to single pixels for fine detail. We’ve also improved performance so it can handle more regions with ease.

Additionally, Mac users can now use two fingers to pinch zoom and pan images for all annotation tasks.

</video>

For more information, see [BitmaskLabels](/tags/bitmasklabels).

#### Custom global hotkeys

You can now [**configure global hotkeys**](hotkeys) for each user account. These are available from the **Account & Settings** page.

#### Annotation summary by task

When using the **View All** action, users who are in the Reviewer role or higher can now see a summary of the annotations for a specific task. This summary includes metadata, agreements, and side-by-side comparisons of labels.

You can use this summary for a more efficient and detailed review of annotated tasks and to better understand consensus and discrepancies, especially when needing to compare the work of multiple annotators.

### Enhancements

#### SDK 2.0.0

We released a new version of the SDK, with multiple functional and documentation enhancements. 

* [Documentation](https://api.labelstud.io/)

* [Release notes](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio-sdk/releases/tag/2.0.0)

!!! warning
     This release contains breaking changes. If you are currently using the Label Studio SDK package in any automated pipelines, we strongly recommend pinning your SDK version to <2.0.0.

#### Settings for TimelineLabels configurations

When you are using a labeling configuration that includes [`<TimelineLabels>`](/tags/timelinelabels), you will now see a settings icon.

![Screenshot](/images/releases/2-28-settings.png)

From here you can specify the following:

- Playback speed for the video
- Whether to loop timeline regions

#### Bulk annotation actions for annotators

Previously, the [bulk annotation actions](labeling_bulk) were only available to users in the Reviewer role or Manager and higher.

Now, users in the Annotator role can access these action.

Note that this is only available when the project is using Manual distribution and annotators must have access to the Data Manager.

#### Project page improvements

You now have the option to view the **Projects** page in list format rather than as a grid of cards:

![Screenshot](/images/releases/2-28-projects.png)

In the list view, you see will a condensed version of the project information that includes fewer metrics, but more projects per page:

**(Admin view)**

**(Annotator view)**

##### Search and sort projects

This change also includes a new option to sort projects (available in either view):

![Screenshot](/images/releases/2-28-projects-sort.png)

You can also now search by project description and project ID.

#### Workspace improvements

There have been several improvements to the workspace list:

- The list is now sorted alphabetically.
- When editing the project settings and selecting a workspace in which to move the workspace, the drop-down list is now searchable.
- You can now click a link in the project breadcrumbs to navigate back to a specific workspace.

#### GPT-5 models for Prompts

When using an OpenAI API key, you will now see the following models as options:

`gpt-5`

`gpt-5-mini`

`gpt-5-nano`

#### Organization-level control over email notifications

The **Organization > Usage & License** page has new options to disable individual email notifications for all members in the organization.

If disabled, the notification will be disabled for all users and hidden from their options on their **Account & Settings** page.

#### Export data from the Members page

There is a new option on the **Members** page to export Annotation Summary data to CSV:

#### Support for high-frequency rate time series data

You can now annotate time series data on the sub-second decimal level.

!!! note 

    Your time format must include `.%f` to support decimals. For example:

    `timeFormat="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f"`

#### Snap bounding boxes to pixels

The [**`<Rectangle>`**](/tags/rectangle) and [**`<RectangleLabels>`**](/tags/rectanglelabels) tags now include the `snap` parameter, allowing you to snap bounding boxes to pixels.

!!! info tip
    To see a pixel grid when zoomed in on an image, you must disable pixel smoothing. This can be done as a parameter on the [**`<Image>`**](/tags/image) tag or from the user settings.

#### Define the default collapsed state

The [**`<Collapse>`**](/tags/collapse) tag now includes an `open` parameter. You can use this to specify whether a content area should be open or collapsed by default.

#### Configure whether to display spectrograms in the labeling configuration

There is a new `spectrogram` parameter for the [**`<Audio>`**](/tags/audio) tag, allowing you to show spectrograms by default

#### New `include` and `filter` fields for the project list API

The [**List all projects**](https://api.labelstud.io/api-reference/api-reference/projects/list) call has been updated with `include` and `filter` parameters.

#### New query params for organization membership

When listing organization members via the API, you can use two new query params to exclude project or workspace members:

`exclude_project_id`

`exclude_workspace_id`

#### Miscellaneous usability and performance improvements

- Removed the default zoom level calculation for Audio, allowing it to render the full waveform by default.

- The **Add Source Storage** modal has been improved for clarity.

- UX improvements for labeling interface information panels.

- Ask AI is now on by default for all new accounts.
