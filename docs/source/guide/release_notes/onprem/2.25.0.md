## Label Studio Enterprise 2.25.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">Prompts on-prem availability, storage proxies, PDF tag, KeyPointLabels support, multi-task JSON imports for cloud</div>

*Jun 17, 2025*

Helm Chart version: [1.9.15](https://github.com/HumanSignal/charts/blob/master/heartex/label-studio/Chart.yaml)

### New features

#### Prompts availability for on-prem deployments

You can now configure your on-prem environment to use Prompts! 

Prompts is an interface to easily integrate LLMs into your own Label Studio deployment. Leading teams use it to pre-label data, compare models, and generate synthetic samples.

You can find out more here:

* [Prompts overview](prompts_overview)
* [Prompts product page](https://humansignal.com/platform/prompts/)
* [Blog - How to Generate Synthetic Data with Prompts in Label Studio](https://humansignal.com/blog/how-to-generate-synthetic-data-with-prompts-in-label-studio/)


Installing Prompts requires license enablement and [additional install steps](install_prompts). Reach out to your CSM to enable a free trial!

#### Storage proxies for cloud files

Label Studio now uses a proxy when accessing media files in connect cloud storages. For more information, see [Pre-signed URLs vs. storage proxies](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/storage#Pre-signed-URLs-vs-Storage-proxies).

Proxy mode is only used when the **Use pre-signed URLs** option is disabled in source storage.

Storage proxies offer secure media access, simplified configuration, and improved performance.

- Keeps data access within Label Studio's network boundary, ideal for on-premise environments
- Enforces strict task-level access control, even for cached files
- Eliminates the need for presigned URLs and CORS configuration
- Solves performance and reliability issues for large files, videos, and audio
- Media is now streamed via proxy, improving compatibility and scalability

#### New PDF tag

A [new PDF tag](/tags/pdf) lets you directly ingest PDF URLs for classification without needing to use hypertext tags.

This also simplifies the process for using PDFs with Prompts for summarization and classification tasks. 



### Enhancements

#### KeyPointLabels exports for COCO and YOLO

COCO and YOLO export formats now available for `KeyPointLabels`. For more information, see [our docs](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/export#COCO). 

#### Multi-task JSON imports for cloud

Previously, if you loaded JSON tasks from source storage, you could only configure one task per JSON file.

This restriction has been removed, and you can now specify multiple tasks per JSON file as long as all tasks follow the same format.

For more information, see the examples in our [our docs](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/storage#Off).


#### Miscellaneous

- The **Export Underlying Data** option was recently introduced and is available from the Annotations chart in the [annotator performance dashboard](dashboard_annotator). This allows you to export information about the tasks that the selected users have annotated. 

    Previously, users were only identified by user ID within the CSV. With this update, you can also identify users by email.

- User interface enhancements for the AI Assistant, including a new icon.


### Bug fixes

- Fixed various user interface issues associated with the new dark mode feature.

- Fixed an issue where the **Not Activated** role was hidden by default on the Organization page.

- Fixed several small issues related to the annotator agreement score popover.

- Fixed an issue where when moving around panels in the labeling interface, groups were not sticking in place.

- Fixed an issue where the token refresh function was not using the user-supplied `httpx_client`.

- Fixed an issue with cloud storage in which tasks would not resolve correctly if they referenced data in different buckets.

- Fixed an issue where the drop-down menu to select a user role was overflowing past the page edge.
